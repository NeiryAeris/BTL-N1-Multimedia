Dataset size: 907 images, 20 classes
##----Dataset loading----##
Preprocess: resize images to 256 x 256 (this step apply for all images in every input phase)
Process 32 images in batch at a time
    Extracting Features: HSV, RGB, Hog, Hu(shape), texture
        - Order of actions: read image --> mask --> contour --> extract --> normalize --> save to DB
            - masking using Otsu technique
            - normalization method: L2 normalization
            - reason of normalize: due to vector's values are in different plane of value. The problem of domination in computing is possible
        - the process are performed in parallel
Model building: get Features out from DB --> perform KNN model building --> save KNN model in to cache

##----Image searching---##
Preprocess: resize image to 256 x 256 resolution
Extracting Features: HSV, RGB, Hog, Hu(shape), texture
    - Order of actions: read image --> mask --> contour --> extract --> normalize --> save to DB
        - masking using Otsu technique
            - normalization method: L2 normalization
    - the process are performed in parallel
Call KNN model --> compute vectors distance (Euclidean) --> result
